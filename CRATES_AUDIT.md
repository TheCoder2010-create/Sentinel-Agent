## Executive Summary

The Rust workspace is a well-structured, multi-crate platform-agent backend. The **core runtime
loop, tool system, provider integrations, JSON-RPC server, transport layer, analytics, sandbox
policy, and MCP client** are all present and compile cleanly. Several crates are **API shells or
minimal stubs** where the business logic is intentionally deferred.

## Per-Crate Analysis

### sentinel-protocol [COMPLETE]
Shared data structures: CompletionRequest/Response, StreamChunk, Message, ContentBlock,
Role, ToolDef, ToolResult, ProviderError. No tests.

### sentinel-config [COMPLETE]
Full YAML-based SentinelConfig loading from ~/.sentinel/, ./.sentinel/, env vars.
Covers providers, models, agent settings, sandbox, MCP. No tests.

### sentinel-provider-info [COMPLETE]
Static catalogue: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Together AI, Groq, Azure, Ollama.
No dynamic discovery. No tests.

### sentinel-provider [PARTIAL - IMPORTANT GAP]
Built: OpenAIProvider (full: chat, streaming SSE, function calling) + AnthropicProvider
(messages endpoint, tool_use blocks, streaming).
MISSING: Gemini provider (listed in info but not implemented). Mistral/Groq/Ollama fall
through to OpenAI-compat. No retry/circuit-breaker. No tests.

### sentinel-core [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
Built: Agent::run() + run_stream(), AgentThread (turn/iteration guard, YOLO mode,
approval queue), Conversation, ContextManager (token budget), SystemPromptManager,
ThreadStore trait + InMemoryThreadStore, AgentOutput types.
MISSING: Persistent thread store (in-memory only). Actual compaction (stub). Multi-agent
coordination not wired. Partial test coverage.

### sentinel-tools [COMPLETE]
10 built-in tools: read, write, edit, glob, grep, bash, web_search (stub!), git_status,
git_diff, git_commit, git_log. ToolRegistry with mutating flags. Sandbox boundary checks.
MISSING: web_search is a stub (no real HTTP). No JSON schema input validation. Tests present.

### sentinel-exec [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
LocalExecutor with timeout, CWD, env vars, output capture. Blocking std::process. 
SandboxPolicy is wired and enforced for can_execute, can_write, and can_read. Tests present.
MISSING: No async execution.

### sentinel-mcp [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
McpClient for stdio-based MCP servers. initialize, tools/list, tools/call. McpTool wrapper
adapts to Tool trait. MISSING: HTTP transport. No reconnection. No tests.

### sentinel-sandbox [PARTIAL - IMPORTANT GAP]
SandboxPolicy struct with can_read/write/execute checks. strict() preset.
platform.rs stubs for Seccomp (Linux) / AppSandbox (macOS) -- these return Ok(()) with no
actual enforcement. Policy IS enforced end-to-end by LocalExecutor.

### sentinel-app-server [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
RequestHandler dispatching all JSON-RPC methods (ping, session CRUD, chat, chat/stream,
history, tools/list, tools/call, fs/read/write/glob/grep, command/exec, config, diagnostics,
auth, events). AppSession per-session state. Server TCP acceptor.
MISSING: Session persistence (HashMap only). No concurrency limit. No tests.

### sentinel-app-server-protocol [COMPLETE]
JSON-RPC 2.0 message types. All method name constants. Request/response param structs.
ServerEvent enum. Fixed duplicate GET_SESSION constant (done in this session). No tests.

### sentinel-app-server-client [COMPLETE]
AppServerConnection enum: Embedded(EmbeddedClient) or Remote(HttpClient). EmbeddedClient
calls RequestHandler in-process. HttpClient with JWT auth. MISSING: No WS streaming client.
No retry. No tests.

### sentinel-app-server-transport [COMPLETE]
TCP, WebSocket, stdio, Unix socket transports. JWT Authenticator. MessageSink trait.
MISSING: No TLS. No message size limit. Unix socket Windows-incompatible.

### sentinel-app-server-daemon [COMPLETE]
PID file management. start/stop/status. MISSING: No log rotation. No auto-restart.
Windows daemonization not implemented. No tests.

### sentinel-analytics [PARTIAL]
AnalyticsPipeline with async mpsc channel + dispatch loop. EventKind enum. Large unused
files (reducer.rs, queue.rs, client.rs) suggest a richer engine not yet wired.
MISSING: Dispatch loop only logs to debug! -- no file/HTTP sink. Tests present.

### sentinel-agent-identity [COMPLETE]
AgentIdentity with Ed25519 key pair, JWT issuance + validation. Tests present.
MISSING: No key rotation. Identities are ephemeral.

### sentinel-agent-graph-store [COMPLETE API, NOT WIRED]
AgentGraphStore trait (upsert/set/list/get/clear). LocalAgentGraphStore SQLite backend.
MISSING: Not wired into sentinel-core agent loop. No migration system. No tests.

### sentinel-cli [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
Full clap CLI: exec, tui, approval, auth, diagnostics, server, plugin (stub), sandbox, display.
MISSING: Plugin loading is stub. No shell auto-completion. Cargo dep fix needed (done).

### sentinel-ai-exec [PARTIAL - IMPORTANT]
Lightweight headless runner. run_main() initializes stack + EmbeddedClient (wired this session).
MockClient for testing. MISSING: No real REPL loop in run_main(). No integration test.

### sentinel-ai-core [STUB - IMPORTANT GAPS]
apply_patch.rs: workspace boundary check + ASCII-only overwrite (NOT a real diff patch).
agents_md.rs: loads AGENTS.md raw string (no parsing).
compact.rs: compact_thread() is entirely a no-op stub. No tests for any module.

### sentinel-ai-tui [PARTIAL - CRITICAL GAP]
App event loop + AppServerSession (wired to EmbeddedClient this session). ChatWidget renders
to stdout. MISSING: No actual TUI -- main.rs shows a static ASCII banner. No ratatui/crossterm.
No scrolling, no cursor input, no real-time rendering.

### sentinel-ai-test-support [THIN]
MockClient + deterministic_events() helper. MISSING: No mock providers, no mock tool registry,
no mock server.

## Cross-Cutting Gaps

### CRITICAL (blocks production use)
- No persistent session storage (sentinel-core, sentinel-app-server)
- apply_patch is an overwrite, not a real diff (sentinel-ai-core)
- No OS sandbox enforcement (sentinel-sandbox, sentinel-exec)
- No Gemini/other providers (sentinel-provider)
- TUI has no real interactive rendering (sentinel-ai-tui)

### IMPORTANT (reduces reliability)
- No LLM-based compaction (sentinel-ai-core, sentinel-core)
- agents_md.rs returns raw string (no parsing or rule extraction)
- web_search tool is a stub
- Analytics dispatches to no real sink
- Agent graph store not wired into agent loop
- No TLS on transport
- Plugin system stub in CLI

### NICE-TO-HAVE (polish)
- JSON Schema validation on tool inputs
- Shell auto-completion for CLI
- Key rotation for agent identity
- Daemon log rotation
- SQLite migration system

## Build Health

  cargo check:  PASS (1 warning: unused imports in handler.rs)
  cargo test:   NOT RUN -- tests exist in: sentinel-core, sentinel-tools,
                sentinel-analytics, sentinel-agent-identity, sentinel-ai-tui
  cargo clippy: NOT RUN

## Fixes Applied This Session
  1. Workspace Cargo.toml -- replaced codex-* with sentinel-ai-*
  2. sentinel-app-server-protocol::api -- removed duplicate GET_SESSION constant
  3. sentinel-app-server::session -- replaced futures::StreamExt with tokio_stream::StreamExt; cloned StreamChunk
  4. sentinel-ai-exec -- replaced MockClient with AppServerConnection::Embedded
  5. sentinel-ai-tui -- replaced MockClient with EmbeddedClient; fixed exec_events private module refs
  6. sentinel-ai-core::compact -- renamed thread to _thread (warning fix)
  7. sentinel-cli -- added sentinel-app-server-protocol dependency
  8. sentinel-app-server::handler -- cleaned up handle_fs_grep placeholder

---

## Recommended Next Steps (4-Week Roadmap)

Week 1 - Reliability:
  1. Persistent sessions: SqliteThreadStore in sentinel-core
  2. Real apply_patch: line-by-line diff, remove ASCII restriction
  3. Fix web_search: call real search API

Week 2 - Completeness:
  4. Gemini provider in sentinel-provider
  5. Wire agent-graph-store into RequestHandler::handle_create_session
  6. Analytics sink: write to ~/.sentinel/analytics.jsonl

Week 3 - Security and UX:
  7. Sandbox enforcement: Seccomp filter on Linux
  8. Real TUI: integrate ratatui + crossterm
  9. LLM compaction: call ModelProvider inside compact_thread()

Week 4 - Testing and CI:
  10. Integration tests: E2E embedded server test
  11. MockProvider in sentinel-ai-test-support
  12. cargo clippy clean
