//! codex-exec – command‑line front‑end for a Codex‑style AI agent.
//!
//! This library contains the core logic that drives the `codex-exec` binary. It
//! parses CLI arguments, creates an (in‑process) application‑server client, and
//! processes the event stream emitted by the agent.
//!
//! The implementation is deliberately lightweight: a mock client is used to
//! provide deterministic output for testing, and the event‑processing pipeline
//! can be swapped for a real client that talks to a Sentinel or Codex server.
