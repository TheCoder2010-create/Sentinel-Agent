//! Context‑window compaction utilities.

//! In a full implementation this module would interact with the LLM to
//! summarise old conversation turns, drop irrelevant messages, and keep the
//! token count under a configurable budget.  Here we provide a very small stub
//! that demonstrates the API surface and can be expanded later.

/// Returns the number of tokens that would have been removed.  The stub simply
